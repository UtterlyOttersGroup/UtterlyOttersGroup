                <h2>Once upon a time, there was an otter..</h2>
                <p class="margintop-sm">The otter wanted to build his own kingdom. To be a brave king, he went on an
                    adventure with his otter friends. He defeated fish, shrimps and clams. Some friends got bit by
                    zombie, he never gave up. He succeeded in claiming a shark tooth and granting himself a nice shark
                    costume. The otter even acquired a mystery magic of fire and ice, helping friends coming back to the
                    life. Finally, the otter and friends were able to defeat the Shark King, “Krahs”. It was the time
                    that the era of the Otter Kingdom has started.
                </p>
                <p>...Long time has passed since then, yet the legacy of the otter is still alive that the otters have
                    become the strongest specie on the Planet Otty. The kingdom now has been changed to the Utterly
                    Otters Group, aka UOG. Not only they are brave, but wise and smart. UOG is the biggest group on the
                    Planet Otty where magic and science coexist!

                                are so many projects that claim to have utilities, coins and whatnot. While there are
                                many great projects out there, most of them are just words that have never been kept.
                                I wouldn’t make false promises that I cannot guarantee and create a coin that does not
                                have any utility to just pump the price for few hours. Instead, I will go back to
                                classic and old school. Make a cool pixel art collection that people would love to have,
                                and, more importantly, make a strong community.
